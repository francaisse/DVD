Project Description:
The high cost of living refers to the amount of money required to maintain a certain standard of living, which includes the cost of necessities such as housing, food, healthcare, education, and transportation. When the cost of living is high, it can be difficult for people to afford these necessities, which can have a negative impact on their overall well-being and quality of life.
The goal of this study is to learn how the high cost of living has affected the majority of adults in England, including how it has affected their ability to afford necessities, overall financial stability, and overall well-being. It is likely that the high cost of living has had a negative impact on many adults in England, and this research aims to better understand the extent of this
impact and to identify potential solutions to address it.
